two dimensional animation - bastardised version of kha2d for only sprite animation

kha2d is great, love it. but this is just for the animation & does not include collision or anything else. just animation.
you will have to use a seperate collision library or roll your own.

thanks go to @robdangerous for being the main cat making kha & everything else.
